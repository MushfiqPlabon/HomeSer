# Strategy Document

## Overview
This document outlines the key architectural decisions for the HomeSer project, particularly focusing on deployment constraints and future scalability.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Deployment on Vercel
- **Reasoning**: Vercel's Python runtime allows for easy deployment of Django applications as serverless functions.
- **Considerations**: 
  - Vercel's free tier has limitations on execution time, so long-running tasks need to be avoided or optimized.
  - Static files will be served using WhiteNoise to ensure compatibility with Vercel's environment.

### 2. State Management
- **Reasoning**: To ensure the application is stateless and can scale effectively on Vercel's serverless infrastructure.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Use external services for database (Supabase), media storage (Cloudinary), and caching (Upstash Redis).
  - Avoid local file storage and in-memory caches that do not persist across function invocations.

### 3. Celery in Eager Mode
- **Reasoning**: Vercel's serverless functions do not support long-running background processes.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Configure Celery to run in eager mode (`CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True`) for immediate task execution.
  - Plan for migration to a dedicated worker service (e.g., Heroku, AWS Lambda) when scaling beyond Vercel's limitations.

### 4. Authentication with JWT
- **Reasoning**: JWT provides a secure and scalable way to manage user sessions without server-side storage.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Use `djangorestframework-simplejwt` with HTTP-only cookies to store tokens securely.
  - Implement refresh token rotation to enhance security.

### 5. Frontend with Tailwind CSS
- **Reasoning**: Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach that integrates well with Django templates.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Install Tailwind CSS v3 via npm and configure it to scan Django templates for classes.
  - Generate CSS during the build process and serve it as a static asset.

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Database Optimization
- Added comprehensive database indexes for all frequently queried fields
- Implemented select_related and prefetch_related to reduce query count
- Added database connection pooling for better performance

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Implemented multi-level caching with user-specific cache keys
- Added cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- Configured appropriate cache TTL values for different data types

### 3. Frontend Performance
- Optimized CSS with Tailwind for minimal bundle size
- Implemented efficient JavaScript with proper event cleanup
- Added loading states and skeleton screens for better UX

### 4. API Optimization
- Implemented pagination for large datasets
- Added request throttling to prevent abuse
- Optimized serializers to reduce data transfer

## Current Development Status

### Completed Features
- ✅ User authentication and role management
- ✅ Service browsing, searching, and detailed views
- ✅ Shopping cart and ordering system
- ✅ Client profiles with bio and social links
- ✅ Review and rating system
- ✅ Admin functionality for user management
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile support
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Microinteractions and animations

### Known Issues (Development State)
- Need to verify CartItem unique constraint implementation
- Should test cache invalidation strategies thoroughly
- Need to validate form handling edge cases
- Should verify all URL patterns work correctly

## Future Considerations
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Design the Order model with a placeholder for future payment gateway integration.
- **Advanced Caching**: Implement Redis-based caching for production deployment.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for all components.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Add application performance monitoring.
- **Advanced Search**: Implement Elasticsearch for better search capabilities.
